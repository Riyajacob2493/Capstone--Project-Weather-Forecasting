# Capstone--Project-Weather-Forecasting
Overview of Problem Statement: Correct estimation of the maximum daily temperature is relevant to agriculture, public health, and urban planning. Knowledge and estimation of maximum temperatures will help minimize risks associated with extreme events due to temperature fluctuations, particularly heatwaves, at differnt cities . However, the temperature becomes pretty hard to predict precisely because historically there are different meteorological factors in play: atmospheric conditions, wind conditions, and other environmental influences. Hence, improved preparedness and decision-making in the concerned domains will be achieved by using historical information on the state of the weather to build an appropriate prediction model for the maximum temperature.

Objective: Develop a predictive model to forecast the maximum temperature (tempmax) based on historical weather data.
